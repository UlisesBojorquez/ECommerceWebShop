## Packages

To install all the packages we need to use ``npm`` to download it all.

```python
npm install @chec/commerce.js
npm install @stripe/react-stripe-js
npm install @stripe/stripe-js
npm install @mui/material
npm install @emotion/react
npm install @emotion/styled
npm install @mui/styles
npm install @mui/icons-material
npm install react-router-dom
npm install react-router-dom #version 6
```
### Important
> For developing testing the payment part don't contain credit card added with Stripe, so successful payment has just a text and cart still with the same products.
